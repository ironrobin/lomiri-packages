TODO: 

- Install Lomarchi
- Find out what is needed to minimally boot Lomarchi on desktop
- Figure out touch
- For those minimal packages
- Discern runtime deps vs buildtime deps
Runtime dependency (depends): something the program needs when installed/used by the end user.

Build-time dependency (makedepends): something that is only needed to compile or generate the package, but isnâ€™t required after installation.

TODO: Every time i start an ayatana / lomiri indicator, lomiri crashes. I think it might have to do with gmenuharness but not sure.
